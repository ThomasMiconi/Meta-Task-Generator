=== Randomly  generated meta-reinforcement learning task ===
We print out the transition  matrix, the range for each state variable, the reward rules, the flag-setting rules, and the stimuli for each state.
Conventions:
-  "-1" means "empty / don't care"
- State  number 100+k (100, 101, 102...) indicates the k-th state variable (i.e. special state 0, 1, 2... respectively, each of which is replaced with a randomly chosen state number for each new task.)
- Probability value 1000+k  (1000, 1001, 1002...) indicates probability variable k  (i.e. special probability value 0, 1, 2... respectively, each of which is replaced with a randomly chosen probability in (0,1) for each new task.)
- Probability value 2000+k  (2000, 2001, 2002...) indicates "one minus probability variable k".
- Stimulus number 1000+k indicates variable stimulus k (each of which is randomly resampled for each new task)

### This entire code generates one single meta-learning task.

# More precisely, after setting the paraameters, we repeatedly try to generate
# a meta-task and test whether it meets certain criteria. If so, we accept it,
# otherwise we try again.

# Most of the complexity  in this code results from attempts at introducing
# some structure and some filtering in the process, in the hope of biasing it
# towards more interesting / interpretable meta-tasks.


### The following parameters are common to all meta-learning tasks that this code generates:

N = 4       # Number of states
NBA =  2    # Number of actions for each state
PROBAUSEOLDSTATE=  1.0      # Probability that a rule specification will include the starting state
PROBAUSENEWSTATE=  0.0      # Probability that a rule specification will include the next  state
PROBAUSEACTION=  .33        # Probability that a rule specification will include the action
NBSTATEVARIABLES= 1          # Number of different state variables
NBSPECIALPROBAS = 2         # Number of different probability variables
PROBANOSTIM =  .2           # Probability that a given state provides no stimulus/observation


NBVARSTIM = 2       # Number of different stimulus variables
NBFIXEDSTIM = 3     # Number of different fixed stimuli



### The following parameters are randomly chosen for each meta-task generation:

NBR = np.random.choice([1, 1, 1, 2, 3])     # Number of reward rules
NBFR = np.random.choice([1, 1, 1, 2])       # Number of flag rules

# Parameters for generating rules (for rewards and flags):
# Note that many of these will be zero for most generated meta-tasks. This is a design choice - we assume most meta-tasks do not need the relevant variability. 
PROBASTATEISVARIABLE = np.random.choice([0.0, 0.0, .5])  # Probability that the 'state' component of a given rule will actually be a variable. 
PROBAREWARDISPROBABILISTIC = np.random.choice([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]) # Probaility that the reward for a given rule is probabilistic (either no reward is probabilistic, or all are)
PROBAREWARDPROBAISVARIABLE =  np.random.choice([.2, .5, .8]) # *If* a reward is probabilisitc, probability that it's a variable
PROBAEACHRULEUSESFLAG = np.random.choice([0.0, 0.0, .5])  # Flags should be used sparingly



#### From now on  we generate the meta-task automatically

OK = False # Should we accept this generated meta-task?

    # Generate the range for each special state variable. When generating a new individual task, this special state variable 
    # will be assigned a value randomly sampled from this range.

    # Pick the stimuli (more precisely, their IDs).

    # Stimulus number k >= 1000 indicates a stimulus variable, to be randomly resampled for each new individual task.

    # Transition function: For each state and action, a probability distribution over all states.
    # In many case, this distribution should be a one-hot vector. Even most of the remaining cases should be two-hot vectors(only two possilbe options).
    # But not always, sometimes more options.
    # Furthermore, the same distribution (or sometimes, if two-hot, its mirror image) should  sometimes be replicated over all actions.
    # Only allowed probabilities are binary (equal prob amobg non-zero), or one bigger than the others.
    # The actual process, and the probability values used below, are somewhat arbitrary. They seem to produce OK results.
