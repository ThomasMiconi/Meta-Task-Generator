# Meta-Task-Generator

A small program that automatically generates simple meta-tasks from a
parametrized space. The parametrization is expressive enough to include bandit
tasks, the Harlow  task, the two-step tasks, T-mazes, and other meta-tasks.

The main code is in `tasks.py`. Running the script generates and prints out the
specification for one meta-task. Conventions are included in the printout. 

The file `ExampleTasks.py` contains the specifications for the three randomly generated meta-tasks described in the preprint.

Work in progress.
