# Simpler version of the code for randomnly generating meta-reinforcement learning tasks,

=== Randomly  generated meta-reinforcement learning task ===
We print out the transition  matrix, the range for each state variable, the reward rules, the flag-setting rules, and the stimuli for each state.
Conventions:
-  "-1" means "empty / don't care"
- State  number 100+k (100, 101, 102...) indicates the k-th state variable (i.e. special state 0, 1, 2... respectively, each of which is replaced with a randomly chosen state number for each new task.)
- Probability value 1000+k  (1000, 1001, 1002...) indicates probability variable k  (i.e. special probability value 0, 1, 2... respectively, each of which is replaced with a randomly chosen probability in (0,1) for each new task.)
- Probability value 2000+k  (2000, 2001, 2002...) indicates "one minus probability variable k".
- Stimulus number 1000+k indicates variable stimulus k (each of which is randomly resampled for each new task)
